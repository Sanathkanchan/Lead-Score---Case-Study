# Lead-Score---Case-Study
## Problem Statement
An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. <br>
## Goals and Objectives
There are quite a few goals for this case study.
- Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
- There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.

### Conclusion
It was found that the variables that mattered the most in the potential buyers are (In descending order) :
- The total time spend on the Website.
- Total number of visits.
- Where the lead source was: 
    - Google
    - Direct traffic
    - Organic search
    - Welingak website
- When the last activity was:
    - SMS
    - Olark chat conversation<br>
- When the lead origin is Lead add format.
- When their current occupation is as a working professional.

Keeping these in mind the X Education can flourish as they have a very high chance to get almost all the potential buyers to change their mind and buy their courses.
